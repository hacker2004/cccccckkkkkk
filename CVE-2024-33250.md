\8. You can see that the attack echo was successful.

 

 

#### 2. **Reproduction process(Using NC listening test)**

\1. Access this address：https://stream-east.dreamcaster.app/console/en_index.html#/connect

 

\2. Enter the monitoring IP in the server IP, click on connect, use burp suite to capture and view data packets, and send them. It can be seen that NC has successfully captured the request sent from the other server

#### **Repair suggestions：**

Strictly validate and filter user input to prevent users from having control over the request target.

 

Restrict the target of server requests, such as restricting access to trusted domain names or IP addresses on the whitelist

 

Minimize server access to external resources and avoid exposing the server to the public network.

 

Regularly audit and monitor the network traffic and DNS resolution requests of the server, promptly detect abnormal activity and handle it.

 

Update and maintain security patches on the server to prevent known vulnerabilities from being exploited.
